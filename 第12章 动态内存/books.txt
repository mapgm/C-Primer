I believe there is a person who brings sunshine into your life.

That person may have enough to spread around. But if you really 

have to wait for someone to bring you the sun and give you a 

good feeling, then you may have to wait a long time.

In the flood of darkness, hope is the light. It brings comfort, 
faith, and confidence.It gives us guidance when we are lost, and 
gives support when we are afraid. And the moment we give up 
hope, we give up our lives. The world we live in is 
disintegrating into a place of malice and hatred, where we need 
hope and find it harder. In this world of fear, hope to find 
better, but easier said than done, the more meaningful life of 
faith will make life meaningful.
